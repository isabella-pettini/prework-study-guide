        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element also contains metadata for the web application.</li>
          <li>Metadata contains important information about accessibility, search engines and performance.</li>
          <li>Metadata is not typically seen by the user but it helps the browser use data to best serve the webpage to users.</li>
          <li>The title element is a metadata tag inside the head element.</li>
          <li>The title element gives a title to the webpage and is required for SEO aka Search Engine Optimization.</li>
          <li>SEO improves the ranking of your webpage. This means your webpage will show up more often in search engines like Google or Bing.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author and viewport.</li>
          <li>Character set UTF-8 allows you to use most characters and symbols on a webpage.</li>
          <li>The style element defines CSS styles associated with a webpage.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The body element helps provide a positive user experience.</li>
          <li>Elements nested inside other elements are called Child Elements. The element that holds all the children elements is called the Parent element.</li>
          <li>It is important to use Semantic HTML elements as it makes it easier to read by the browser and other developers.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML also makes sure the webpage is accessible to users who may use screen readers or other assistive technologies.</li>
          <li>Headings help organize a page by being more prominent titles and sub-titles.</li>
          <li>Order matters in headings, make sure to use h1 through h6. Only use h1 once per page.</li>
          <li>The p element wraps most text on a webpage.</li>
          <li>The ul element is for unordered lists.</li>
          <li>The ol element is for ordered lists.</li>
          <li>The li element is for list items.</li>
          <li>The img element gives infomation about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
          <li>The src attribute defines the location/source of the image file.</li>
          <li>The alt atrribute contains a text string that gives a description of the image.</li>
          <li>The alt text is important for users who use assistive technologies like screen readers.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS adds color and style. It defines colors and aesthetics to our webpage.</li>
          <li>CSS also helps with organization and page layout.</li>
          <li>CSS will help define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a large range of style options.</li>
          <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage with CSS; Inline CSS, Internal CSS & External CSS.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is useful for quick and permanent changes but it is less flexible than Internal/External CSS as you must edit individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS has CSS rules for the webpage inside of the head section of the HTML file. A single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS and Internal CSS are perfectly good methods under the right circumstances but the most common way to style a webpage is External CSS.</li>
          <li>External CSS makes design changes easier as it allows you to keep all CSS rules in a separate file.</li>
          <li>Separation of Concerns is a key design principle based on the idea that each section of code should have its own file/responsibility based on its use.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules/declarations will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain 2 important components: CSS property we want to apply & value of the property.</li>
          <li>Ex: Color:Blue. Color = CSS property & Blue = the value for that property.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>When we want to apply a rule to all elements that are visible on a webpage we can use * symbol as a wildcard selector.</li>
          <li>Two or more elements that we want to style the same can be combined into a single CSS rule separated by a comma so declarations can affect all the elements we want the same.</li>
          <li>DRY code aja “Do not Repeat Yourself” code encourages us to reduce the number of lines of code. This will reduce the overall size & complextivity of a code base.</li>
          <li>We can also apply CSS rules to images.</li>
          <li>After we have created a CSS file we need to link it to our HTML file by using the link element.</li>
          <li>We can add the link element inside the head element in the HTML file (where the metadata is stored). This will create the connection to our CSS file.</li>
          <li>Using a Class Attribute as a selector allows us to add styles to certain elements but not all.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to freely pick and choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done with semantic references like gray/blue or with a hexadecimal code aka hex #.</li>
