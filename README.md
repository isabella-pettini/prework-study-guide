This study guide is broken down into four sections: HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. These sections contain notes taken through the pre-work course on the basics of those topics. Opening the DevTools console by either right-clicking and selecting 'inspect' or by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows) will show those same four topics along with a randomly generated suggestion on what to study first.
